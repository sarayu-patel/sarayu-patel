//A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
//Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
//Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
//Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
//Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.//
